I'm a pre-med student who current studies Pharmaceutical Chemistry in UC Davis. 
As a diligent Senior college student, I maintained a full GPA of 4.0 for all four years in UC Davis and received scholarship for my hardworks.
I'm interested in Chemistry, Biology, and Neuro-Science.

FYI, I'm a huge fan of the notorious TV show "Office". Michael! I said Michael!!!

Well, I don't want to brag about it, but I have a good taste for music. My favorite music band is "Greenday".
